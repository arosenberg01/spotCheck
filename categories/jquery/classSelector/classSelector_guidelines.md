##CenterDiv Guidelines
-----------------------

###Clarifying Questions (when asked in person):

- In Javascript, what type of entity is the jQuery library?

    - jQuery is just a function that returns an array-like structure of DOM elements.

- What instantiation patterns make sense for this approach?

    - Any of them would work, just giving you a hint to give me back an object :)

###Rubric:

  - **Remote:**

    - Run student's code and review. Pass or Fail based on whether or not an HTMLCollection, object, or array-like structure is returned with DOM elements matching the query.

  - **In person:**

    - **Pass** (Achieves 2 out of 3 learning objectives):
        - [ ] Student understands jQuery is just a function
        - [ ] Student remembers utilization of document.getElementsByClassName, or at least remembers there's something like it available.
        - [ ] Student seems to understand how to implement whatever instantiation pattern they choose
        - [ ] Student understands that a jQuery collection (and a D3 collection) are not the same thing as an array.
    
    - **Fail** (Student achieves less than 2 of the previous learning objectives)
