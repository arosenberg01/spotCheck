##TopMenu Guidelines
-----------------------

###Clarifying Questions (when asked in person):

- You've been asked to develop a landing page for your company. How would you style a top horizontal menu for the site?

    - We would use an unordered list and list items for each menu item.
    - Important things to include in the CSS:
    - { list-style: none; } on the 'ul'
    - { display: inline; } or inline-block on the 'li'
    - nice to have: styling on link hover 

###Rubric:

  - **Remote:**

    - Run student's code and review. Pass or Fail based on whether or not menu is styled correctly (no bullet points and horizontal).

  - **In person:**

    - **Pass** (Achieves 1 out of 2 learning objectives):
        - [ ] Student articulates how to style the menu
        - [ ] Student writes CSS that styles menu correctly (no bullet points and horizontal)
    
    - **Fail** (Student achieves less than 1 of the previous learning objectives)
