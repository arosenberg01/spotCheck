##CenterDiv Guidelines
-----------------------

###Clarifying Questions (when asked in person):

- Why do the inner div need to have the width property?

    - It needs to have some width; without a width the browser wouldn't know where the div's center is and would not be able to render it centered relative to it's container

- What happens if we change the width to 100%? 

    - The inner container and the outer container will be the same width and will be centered. However, the text in #inner by default will be left-aligned and appear to be in the left corner of #inner

###Rubric:

  - **Remote:**

    - Run student's code and review. Pass or Fail based on whether or not inner div gets centered.

  - **In person:**

    - **Pass** (Achieves 2 out of 3 learning objectives):
        - [ ] Student articulates why we need a width property
        - [ ] Student explains what happens if width is changed to 100%
        - [ ] Student writes CSS that centers inner div
    
    - **Fail** (Student achieves less than 2 of the previous learning objectives)
