##Backbone ToDo List Guidelines
-------------------------------

###Clarifying Questions (when asked in person):

* This is a basic Backbone todo list app. The views are provided and should not be altered.

- What is the purpose of line 33 in taskListView.js?
  
  - It invokes the countIncomplete function which counts all the incomplete tasks.

- Fill in the model (`task.js`) and collection (`tasks.js`) code so that:
  * [ ] clicking an incomplete task causes it to be crossed out, and the number of incomplete tasks to decrement
  * [ ] clicking a completed task causes it to no longer be crossed out, and the number of incomplete tasks to increment


###Rubric:

  - **Pass** (Scores 3 out of 5 points):
      - [ ] 1 point - Student articulates purpose of line 33
      - [ ] 2 points - Student writes code that crosses task in / out when clicked
      - [ ] 2 points - Student writes code to increment / decrement incomplete tasks count
  
  - **Fail** (Student scores less than 3 points)
