## Backbone Todo List
* This is a basic Backbone todo list app. The views are  provided for you, and you must not alter them. Your task is to fill in the model (`task.js`) and collection (`tasks.js`) code so that:
  * [ ] clicking an incomplete task causes it to be crossed out, and the number of incomplete tasks to decrement
  * [ ] clicking a completed task causes it to no longer be crossed out, and the number of incomplete tasks to increment
