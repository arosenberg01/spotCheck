##basicServer Guidelines
-----------------------

###Clarifying Questions (when asked in person):

- What are the easiest ways to test if your express routes are working? (especially useful for non-GET requests)

    - Postman or the command line tool 'curl'

###Rubric:

  - **Remote:**

    - Run student's code and review. Pass or Fail based on whether or not the student's route handling works correctly

  - **In person:**

    - **Bonus points**
        - [ ] Student saves the express module to a package.json file

    - **Pass** (Achieves 3 out of 3 learning objectives):
        - [ ] Student correctly instantiates an express instance and sets it to listen to a port
        - [ ] Student writes express route for GET requests to '/'
        - [ ] Student writes express route for all other requests
    
    - **Fail** (Student does not achieve all of the previous learning objectives)
