# Contributing to the spotCheck guide

## Workflow

This is GitHub, my friends, so let's do it the clean way:

  0. Here's the [waffle project](https://waffle.io/so-spotcheck/spotCheck) for our repo. You'll be able to see which issues everyone is currently working on.
  1. Fork this repo
  2. Work on your own fork
  3. Create a branch to work on an issue the [waffle.io way](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/FAQs#automatically-move-issues-in-progress-1)
  3a. Example branch name: `git checkout so-spotcheck/spotCheck#2` to start work on issue #2. 
  4. When you make a commit that closes an issue make sure append your commit with 'Closes #(insert issue number here)'. This will move the task in waffle.io automatically. 
  3. Create a **Pull Request** towards this repo's `master` branch.  Craft a nice title and description so I get a good sense of what you were doing in there.
